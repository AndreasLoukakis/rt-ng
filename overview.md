## How to use this repo
- Create and cd in a local directory `mkdir rtng && cd rtng`
- Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/AndreasLoukakis/rt-ng.git`
- If git is not an option, go to [github repo](https://github.com/AndreasLoukakis/rt-ng) and download a zip of the repo. However, there will be some inconvenience to switch from / to various branches so try to have git available.
- Each part will have course contents in an md format and two branches: xCourse-start and xCourse-finished
- We should start with the x-start branch and move to the x-finish branch during the course
- Each course will also include an extras.md with proposed exercises and recommended reading. The exercises will be discussed at the beginning of each next course.

## Following along (not)
 - It is not recommended to follow along. There will be a branch specific for each live session, updated regularely so you can pull changes and access the session code.

## Prerequisites
 - Good understanding of Javascript (ES5)
 - Basics of angular 2+ (any introductory course)
 - Basics of typescript & OOP

## Good to have
 - Some experience with ES6+ (destructuring, arrow functions, let, const ...)
 - Some experience with RxJS Observables (or similar implementation of the Observable pattern)
 - Understanding of basic git commands

## Through the courses we will...
 - Quickly go through the basic parts of an Angular application:
    - Angular CLI
    - Environment
    - App bootstraping
    - Building blocks
    - Test environment
    - Dev tools
- Build a basic application
- Incrementally add complexity & features
- Investigate best practices, review and refactor when necessary
- Import and use STK modules


## We will not...
 - Go through each and every detail of every angular / typescript / x-library feature. You are expected to spend some time to further investigate and practice.
 - Each course will end with a branch you should install for practice and some recommended reading
