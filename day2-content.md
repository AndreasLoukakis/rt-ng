# IA2 Angular course - day 2

## Reviewing the exercise: Build a UI shell module



![Diagram: app bootstraping](./diagrams/3.shell_module.svg)

And that will be your exercise. The solution is ready in day2-start branch but try to take it as far as you can on your own.

The content of the componens can be dummy text or just empty if you prefer.

This module will be a part of the rendered view at all times, so it doesn't make any sense to consider lazy-loading it, in case you were thinking about it (we'll talk about lazy loading while developing the next module).

You can use custom html and css if you wish, but our implementation will be based on patternfly. A good example is [this page layout](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/documentation/core/demos/page/default-nav)
