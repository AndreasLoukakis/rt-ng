(This is a work in progress)
***
## Prerequisites
 - Good understanding of Javascript (ES5)
 - Basics of angular 2+
 - Basics of typescript & OOP
 - Have watched angular basics and typescript basics of ultimate angular (or other similar course)

## Good to have
 - Some experience with ES6+ (destructuring, arrow functions, let, const ...)
 - Some experience with RxJS Observables
 - Some experience with basic git commands

## Through the courses we will...
 - Quickly go through the basic parts of an Angular application:
    - Angular CLI
    - Environment
    - App bootstraping
    - Building blocks
    - Test environment
    - Dev tools
- Build a basic application
- Incrementally add complexity & features
- Investigate best practices, review and refactor when necessary
- Import and use STK modules
- (hopefully) Consume Api Gateway

## We will not...
 - Go through each and every detail of every angular / typescript / x-library feature. You are expected to spend some time to further investigate and practice.
 - Each course will end with a branch you should install for practice and some recommended reading
